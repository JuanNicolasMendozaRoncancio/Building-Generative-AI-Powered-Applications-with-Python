Here are a few examples of how you can use prompt engineering with GPT-3 to customize the voice assistant for different purposes:

* Therapist:
To create an assistant that can provide support and guidance to users who are struggling with mental health issues, you can design prompts that are related to therapeutic conversations. For example, you could start the prompt with "Hello, I'm feeling overwhelmed and stressed today. Can you help me cope with my feelings?" and the assistant could generate a response that provides advice and encouragement.

* Mechanic:
To create an assistant that can diagnose and troubleshoot car problems, you can design prompts that ask questions about the symptoms of the car and the possible causes of the problem. For example, you could start the prompt with "My car is making a strange noise when I accelerate. What could be the cause of this?" and the assistant could generate a response that suggests possible solutions based on its knowledge of car repair.

* Storyteller:
To create an assistant that is able to generate original stories on demand, you can design prompts that provide a starting point for the story and let the assistant take it from there. For example, you could start the prompt with "Once upon a time, there was a young princess who lived in a castle. One day, she received a magical gift that changed her life forever. What was the gift and how did it change her life?" and the assistant could generate a unique and engaging story based on that prompt.

* Professor:
To create an assistant that can teach users about a specific subject, you can design prompts that provide lesson material and ask questions to test the user's understanding. For example, you could start the prompt with "In this lesson, we will be learning about the properties of matter. What are the three states of matter?" and the assistant could generate a response that provides an explanation and a quiz to test the user's knowledge.

* By carefully designing the prompts and using the power of GPT-3, you can create an assistant that can perform a wide variety of tasks and provide valuable information to users. The key is to think about the type of output that you want the assistant to generate and design the prompts accordingly. All that's left is creating a beautiful UI/UX around these prompts and you've got yourself a million-dollar business!
